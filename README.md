‘Native SutraTM‘ literally means the thread (Sutra) that connects you to your home / place of birth (Native). And our brand’s identity expresses that very idea.
The brand value of “connection” is expressed with a circle connecting the letters ‘V’ and ‘A’. The circle represent the globe which corresponds to our clients all over the world. The end of letter ‘V’ and ‘A’ are extended such that they align at an angle 24° forming the axis of the globe.
In short, a ‘global connection’.
